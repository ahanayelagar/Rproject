```{r}
fraudTest <- read.csv("class_data/fraudTest.csv")

frauds <- filter(fraudTest,is_fraud==1)

not_frauds <- filter(fraudTest,is_fraud==0)

str(fraudTest)
# str(frauds)
# str(not_frauds)
```

## Which jobs result in the highest fraudulent amount spent?

We created a new data frame called 'frauds_20', which shows the top 20 jobs, sorted by greatest 'amt_sum', or fraudulent amount sum. 

We started by grouping our 'frauds' data frame seen above by job, then using the summarize() function to create our amt_sum variable, then then the arrange() function to order our jobs from greatest to least. 


```{r setup, echo=FALSE}
frauds_20 = frauds %>% 
  group_by(job) %>% 
  summarize(amt_sum = sum(amt, na.rm = T)) %>%
  arrange(desc(amt_sum)) %>% 
  head(20)

frauds_20 = frauds_20 %>% 
  mutate(job2 = reorder(job, amt_sum, na.rm = TRUE, decreasing = FALSE))

ggplot(data = frauds_20)+
  geom_col(aes(x = job2, y = amt_sum))+
  coord_flip()+
  labs(x = "Top 20 Professions", y = "Fraudulent Amount Spent (USD)")
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots Title

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
